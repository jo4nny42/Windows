They did this in search of the Triforce, the ultimate power capable of granting any wishes of its holder. This power, passed down by the Golden Goddesses, was guarded by The Goddess Hylia, the goddess of the land. The Goddess Hylia gathered the Triforce and the remaining survivors onto a piece of earth and sent it skyward beyond the clouds. This piece of land came to be known as Skyloft. With the humans safe, The Goddess Hylia joined the land dwellers and fought the evil forces in a war of unmatched scale and ferocity. The Goddess Hylia eventually sealed the evil forces away, restoring peace to the Surface. However, the humans remained in Skyloft, as The Goddess Hylia knew that the seal on the evil would not hold forever. The Goddess Hylia knew that she would be powerless to stop the forces for a second time, so she required the use of the Triforce to defeat them again. However, a goddess cannot use the Triforce, so The Goddess Hylia gave up her immortality and was reincarnated as a mortal Hylian. Skyward Sword's in-game story establishes itself as the first game in the known Zelda timeline, exploring the beginning of the battle between good and evil within the legend, and establishing its key players: Zelda, as the incarnation of the Goddess Hylia, Link, the hero chosen by the Goddesses, and Ganondorf, as the manifestation of the Demon King Demise's hatred." >

Inside the castle, they meet up with the gathered six Maidens, whose purpose is to protect Hyrule as well as the Four Sword Sanctuary. With the help of the maidens, Zelda summons a portal to the sanctuary. However, before they get a chance to enter, a dark figure that looks like Link appears.

Likewise, the seal on Vaati is broken, and he slowly creeps forward with a maniacal laugh. The four Links do not get a chance to follow the Dark Link before being thrown away from the scene by Vaati's magic.

Shadow Link, as he calls him, has spread chaos in Hyrule, scorching villages and throwing them into the dark world. Traveling across Hyrule they witness the chaos brought about by Vaati and Shadow Link, and in order to release the dark seals placed by Vaati, the four Links must collect force gems in order to properly power up the Four Swords and grant it the power to repel evil.">

In order to do this, Ganondorf would require not only the three Spiritual Stones of Hyrule, but also the mystical Ocarina of Time.

In her misery, the princess isolated herself as the rest of the kingdom wept for her fate. Fear began to rise among the populace of Hytopia, as people grew afraid of fashion in fear of being cursed as well. As only chosen heroes could enter the Drablands, her father, King Tuft, sent out a notification to kingdoms near and far asking for heroes to assemble, promising a great reward. A prophecy within the kingdom, however, tells of the Tri Force Heroes, who are described as having pointy ears, sideburns, and side-parted hair, who come together to form a Totem. The prophecy goes on to say that once the Tri Force Heroes have overcome all challenges, the kingdom of Hytopia will be blessed with everlasting peace and style.

But there is more than one person claiming to be that hero. While passing through the land on his travels, Link notices King Tuft's sign asking for heroes to assemble.

Worried, he visited the reigning Zelda's nursemaid, Impa, who was shocked by the mark and took Link to North Castle, where Link opened a door that only he could open, and found a sleeping woman. The woman was another Princess Zelda. Impa then told Link the legend of Zelda handed down in Hyrule:            
                    Long ago a great ruler of Hyrule maintained peace using the Triforce, but once he died the Prince took over but only inherited the Triforce in part. A magician told him that before dying, the king told the Prince's sister, Princess Zelda, something about the Triforce. The Prince and the magician inquired about this, but she would say nothing. Against the Prince's orders, the magician put Zelda into a sleep from which she was not supposed to awake. In his grief, the Prince placed Zelda in the room where Link and Impa now stood and ordered that all female children of the royal household were to be named Zelda.
                    In a scroll only he could read, Link read of the three types of Triforce: Power, Wisdom, and Courage. The Triforce will show its true power when the three are brought together. Power and Wisdom were left in the kingdom, but Courage was hidden away until such a time as someone with extremely noble character appears. It is hidden in the Great Palace in the Valley of Death on Hyrule's largest island. Link must defeat the guardians and place the crystals in all of the palaces, then defeat the final guardian to reclaim the Triforce of Courage, thereby wake Zelda from her slumber and restoring peace to Hyrule.">

Like most games in the series, Diamond and Pearl feature eight Pokémon Gyms led by Gym Leaders, professional trainers whose expertise lies in a particular Pokémon type. Gym Leaders serve as bosses and reward skilled trainers with Gym Badges, key to the advancement of the plot. As with all core games, the protagonist must also thwart the schemes of a crime syndicate, in this case, Team Galactic, who plan to use Pokémon to create a new universe just for themselves, while destroying the current one. As with all other Pokémon role-playing games, Diamond and Pearl begin in the protagonist's hometown. After viewing a television report about a media-conducted search for a red Gyarados, which was spotted at a faraway lake, the protagonist and their best friend, Barry by default, travel together to check the local lake for a Pokémon like it. They spot Professor Rowan, a Pokémon evolution researcher, and his assistant, the playable character not selected in the game: Lucas (boy) or Dawn (girl). After a short discussion, the professor and his assistant leave the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by a wild Starly each, the protagonist and their rival decide to examine the briefcase. They are then given a choice of one of three Pokémon found within—the Grass-type Turtwig, the Fire-type Chimchar, or the Water-type Piplup—and proceed to battle the attacking Pokémon. After defeating the Starly, Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to the professor. Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist and his or her chosen Pokémon, Rowan offers it to them, asking that they embark on a journey and fill their Pokédex. The protagonist encounters the antagonistic group, Team Galactic, early in the game, when he or she must save Professor Rowan from some of their thugs; however, their motives are unclear until later. The player encounters Team Galactic again when they take over a wind farm and when they set up a base in Eterna City, before eventually taking over Sinnoh's three lakes in an attempt to capture the Mirage Pokémon Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit. Shortly after the player earns their seventh Gym Badge, Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building, where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain, an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia in Pearl, or Dialga in Diamond. After releasing the trio, the protagonist is able to access Spear Pillar, an ancient ruin atop Mt. Coronet, where the leader of Team Galactic summons Dialga or Palkia. The legendary Pokémon's powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh, causing the newly free Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit to attempt to stop it. The player then battles Palkia or Dialga, and after defeating or capturing the Pokémon, Sinnoh returns to normal. Afterwards, the player continues their journey, eventually making it to the Sinnoh region Pokémon League's Elite Four. After defeating all four members, they then battle the Sinnoh League Champion, a woman named Cynthia, who had appeared before in the game. After the protagonist defeats Cynthia, they become the new Sinnoh League Champion, finishing the main story. In the post-game, there is a new island to explore that contains Pokémon not seen in the main game, and has some new stores and a tournament center. The protagonist's old friend, who challenged them to battles multiple times before, will also be waiting for them here and will challenge them to one more battle.">

The protagonist of Pokémon Black and White is Hilbert and Hilda, who journeys through Unova to become the Pokémon master. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either Snivy, Tepig or Oshawott as their starter Pokémon as a gift from Professor Juniper. The protagonist's friends, Cheren and Bianca, are also rival Pokémon Trainers who occasionally battle the player; Cheren will choose the Pokémon with a type advantage against the player's, while Bianca will choose the Pokémon with a type disadvantage. The player's primary goal is to obtain the eight Gym Badges of Unova and ultimately challenge the Elite Four of the Pokémon League, and its Champion, to complete the main story. In addition to the standard gameplay, the player will also have to defeat the games' main antagonist force, Team Plasma, a Knights Templar-esque group who claim that Pokémon are oppressed by humanity and seek to liberate them from their trainers.Team Plasma is led by N, a young man who was brought up alongside Pokémon and sees them as friends rather than tools for sport. Throughout the game, the player has some encounters with N, who claims that by capturing one of the legendary Pokémon (Reshiram and Zekrom) of Unova and defeating the Pokémon Champion Alder, he will be recognized as Unova's hero and will be able to convince the humans to part with their Pokémon. Depending on the game version, N will capture Zekrom in Black or Reshiram in White. After the player defeats the Elite Four and enters the Champion's chamber, he or she finds that N has defeated Alder and become the newest Pokémon Champion. Soon after, he summons a large castle surrounding the Pokémon League, challenging the player to find him to participate in one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in Black or Zekrom in White appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pokémon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, Ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left with control over Pokémon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pokémon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his mistake about the nature of the relationship between people and their Pokémon before leaving the castle on his captured Pokémon to a far-off land. After Team Plasma's defeat, Looker arrives in Unova and tasks the player with finding the remaining Sages of Team Plasma, so they can be brought to justice. The player can also challenge the Elite Four once again, and challenge Alder, ultimately becoming the Unova region's new Pokémon Champion. The player also gains access to the eastern portion of Unova, which contains Pokémon from the previous games in the series, as well as access to an area unique to each game version: the ultra-metropolitan Black City, home to powerful Pokémon trainers; and the White Forest, home to humans and Pokémon living in harmony. Cynthia, a former Champion of the Sinnoh region, is also found in this area of the game and can be challenged. A non-player character named after Shigeki Morimoto, a Game Freak programmer, creature designer, and the director of the Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver games, can also be found and battled in the game.">

They live in the new Aspertia City, and receive their starter Pokémon from Bianca, an NPC that served as one of the player's rivals in Black and White. The player also meets Cheren, the other rival character, who is now a Gym Leader in Aspertia City. Much like other Pokémon games, the player travels around the region, battling Gym Leaders to acquire eight Gym Badges, and then goes on to challenge the Elite Four of the Pokémon League and its champion to beat the game. The plot of Black 2 and White 2 features the antagonistic Neo Team Plasma, whom the player first encounters while running an errand, and later when travelling to the first other major city where the team announces its plans to take over the world and steal others' Pokémon in front of the player, the rival, and new Gym Leader Roxie. At the behest of Iris, the player helps Burgh track down more Neo Team Plasma members in the sewers of Castelia City, where the player meets Colress for the first time, who claims to be a researcher of the strengths of Pokémon. Later, it is revealed that Neo Team Plasma has stolen a Purrloin the player's rival was planning on giving to his sister, which makes the rival angry towards the organization, including its reformed former members. After learning about the legendary Pokémon Kyurem, which arrived at the Giant Chasm years ago, the player discovers that Neo Team Plasma is working to use Kyurem to take over the world, harnessing its power to freeze large portions of Unova, including Opelucid City. The player tracks Neo Team Plasma to Humilau City, home of the final new Pokémon Gym led by Marlon, who helps the player battle Neo Team Plasma to remove Kyurem from their grasp. He also helps the rival retrieve his Purrloin, which has since evolved into a Liepard that is used in battle against the player and rival.The battle reaches its climax in the Giant Chasm, where the player discovers Colress is working with Neo Team Plasma to learn more about the capabilities of Pokémon, and that Ghetsis is planning to use Kyurem, the empty Pokémon that is left over from when Zekrom and Reshiram split apart hundreds of years ago, by filling it with his ambition to rule the world. After battling the Shadow Triad with help from the player's rival, who receives his Liepard back, the player enters the inner sanctum of the Giant Chasm where they find Kyurem and Ghetsis. N appears with either his Zekrom in Black 2 or Reshiram in White 2 to try to talk sense into his father Ghetsis, but N's legendary Pokémon is defeated by and fused with Kyurem, transforming it into Black Kyurem in Black 2 or White Kyurem in White 2, and forcing the player to battle it. After defeating Kyurem, it separates from N's Pokémon and the player faces Ghetsis, who is stunned that he has been defeated again. N tries to talk sense into him, but Ghetsis leaves, and N thanks the player for his assistance in defeating Neo Team Plasma once and for all. After defeating Neo Team Plasma, the player is finally able to battle the Elite Four and the new Champion of the Unova League, Iris, and complete the main story.After the game's main story is completed, the player is able to challenge N who has taken up residence in his former castle, where upon the defeat of his legendary Pokémon, it turns into the object that once held its essence and N gives it to the player. The player can then bring the item to another part of Unova where it transforms back into the Pokémon and the player can then capture it. Also, after completion of the game, the player can battle former Unova Champion Alder, Sinnoh Champion Cynthia, the former Striaton City Gym Leaders, and take on the Black Tower or White Treehollow challenges in Black City or White Forest, respectively. Through use of a unique game feature called Memory Link, the player can access new content and side quests dependent on the original Black and White games, such as references to the player's name in the previous game, flashback sequences, the ability to capture Pokémon that once belonged to N, battling Cheren and Bianca who reminisce about the protagonist of the previous game, and participating in the Pokémon World Tournament. The player can also challenge N every season with different Pokémon per season by talking to him on a ferris wheel every Friday at Ninbasa City.A new game mechanic introduced in Black 2 and White 2 is the PokéStar Studios side-game, where the player character participates in the filming of a movie involving Pokémon and other actors. A character named Brycen-Man also appears, as Brycen from the original games returned to his movie career. Sabrina also appeared in the side-game. Another new mechanic is the Pokémon World Tournament, where the player battles powerful trainers from the previous games in the series, ranging from Gym Leaders Brock, Misty, Volkner, and Giovanni to Champions Cynthia, Steven Stone, and Lance. Another new mechanic is the Key System, a feature that is unlocked after beating the game. With it, you can unlock difficulties and new additional areas like Black Tower or White Tree within the same version. You can also unlock chambers, where you can capture Regirock, Registeel, and Regice.">

The protagonist of Pokémon X and Y has just moved to a small town called Vaniville Town with their mother. They soon befriend four trainers—Shauna, Tierno, Trevor and their rival Calem or Serena, all of whom were called to meet Professor Sycamore who is the leading professor in the Kalos region in Lumiose City, the main city of Kalos. Receiving either Chespin, Fennekin or Froakie as their starter Pokémon from Tierno, the player begins their adventure. Along the way, they learn of Pokémon Gyms and receive their first badge for defeating Viola, the Santalune City Gym Leader. Thereafter, they encounter Sina and Dexio, assistants of Sycamore, who brings them to the professor himself; however, once in Lumiose City they discover the area to be suffering from a partial power outage. Upon meeting Sycamore in Lumiose City, the player is informed of Mega Evolution and he requests they travel across Kalos and uncover the mysteries behind it. He provides them with one of the Kanto region starter Pokémon and their respective Mega Stone. Before leaving Lumiose City, the player encounters an imposing man named Lysandre who desires a more beautiful world. Continuing their journey, the player encounters the villainous Team Flare, whose goals at first seem to be geared towards making money off of Pokémon. Later encounters with Team Flare reveal their true goal to be the annihilation of humanity to return the world to a pristine, more beautiful state. In Shalour City, the player learns how to use Mega Evolution from the Mega Evolution guru Gurkinn and his granddaughter Korrina, who is the Gym Leader of Shalour City. Defeating Korrina in a special Mega Evolution battle using Lucario, the player is given the ability to freely use Mega Evolution. The player then continues their journey, defeating Gym Leaders and stopping various schemes carried out by Team Flare. In the Lumiose Badlands, the player defeats Team Flare during their attempt to steal energy from the region's power plant and restores power to all of Lumiose City. Once the player obtains their seventh badge, they, and the rest of Kalos, are addressed by Lysandre through the Holo Caster (a holographic communication device); Lysandre informs them of the fact that he is the leader of Team Flare and intends to destroy humanity. Following hints from friends and locals, the player discovers Team Flare's secret lab under a café in Lumiose City where they formally meet a 9-foot (2.7 m) tall man named AZ; he is revealed to be the 3,000-year-old king who once used the ultimate weapon the same device and weapon of mass destruction Lysandre plans to use—which utilized energy from the legendary Pokémon Xerneas or Yveltal to end a war in Kalos. AZ's decision to use the ultimate weapon was motivated by his desire to revive the Pokémon he loved the most, a variant of the Pokémon Floette, although the Pokémon was disgusted with his choice to use the ultimate weapon and left him. This war 3,000 years ago set in motion the events necessary to create Mega Evolution by inadvertently infusing excessive energy into an asteroid. Alongside Shauna and Calem or Serena, the player sets out to stop Team Flare and Lysandre at their second base in Geosenge Town, the location of the ultimate weapon. Upon reaching the core of the weapon, the player discovers a dormant Xerneas or Yveltal which suddenly awakens with their appearance. They capture the legendary Pokémon and proceed to bring an end to Lysandre's plans after defeating him in battle one final time. After the battle, Lysandre will use the ultimate weapon to destroy the ultimate weapon. The player, Shauna, and Calem or Serena, make their escape from the base before this can happen. With the defeat of Team Flare, the player resumes their journey and obtains their eighth and final Gym Badge, enabling them to challenge the Elite Four—the most powerful trainers in Kalos. They traverse Victory Road and reach the Kalos Pokémon League to begin their final challenge. Once they overcome the Elite Four, the player faces and defeats Champion Diantha, making the player the new Champion of Kalos.

One day, the player's friend Hop invites them to meet his big brother Leon, the Champion of the Galar League, so that they both can receive a starter Pokémon from him. After receiving their starters, the player and Hop follow a runaway Wooloo into the Slumbering Weald. Inside the foggy forest, they encounter a mysterious Pokémon that is completely unaffected by moves. After being rescued by Leon, they set out to receive an endorsement from him so that they can participate in Galar's Gym Challenge. After some convincing by Professor Magnolia, Leon agrees to give both the player and Hop an endorsement. Just then, two Wishing Stars fall out of the sky, and Professor Magnolia converts them into Dynamax Bands for the player and Hop, allowing them to Dynamax their Pokémon. The player and Hop then travel together to Motostoke to attend the Gym Challenge's opening ceremony, where they meet Rose, the president of Macro Cosmos and the chairman of the Galar Pokémon League, as well as a band of hooligans known as Team Yell.">

The player visits the Naranja (in Scarlet) or Uva (in Violet) Academy in time for the annual Treasure Hunt, where the rival character, Nemona, encourages the player to explore Paldea and find their own treasure. From there, three stories open up for the player to experience. Starfall Street has the player facing off against a gang of rebellious students called Team Star, the Path of Legends storyline has the player team up with Arven to explore the Paldea region to fight giant Pokémon and obtain the Herba Mystica, and Victory Road follows the series tradition of fighting the region’s eight Gym Leaders in order to face the Champion and become the best Pokémon Trainer. Unlike previous titles in the mainline games, there is no set order for the player to face the Gym Leaders.">
