        <!--Describe techniques used-->
        <div class="techniques"><h1>When brainstorming what I wanted to make this website to look like I landed on resembling a article focused website. In the process I looked on the internet for article styles I liked and replicated them, I also utilized javascript to cycle through an array of quotes I also found online as a nice stylistic choice. Above the quotes I have various a tags taht will take you to different sections of the website so you could jump to different parts of the page. I created a section for Mental Health in the black community because it's not something talked about enough especially for black men then I included a section to explore mental health in a broader sense and include other communities. Lastly included sources for the website I utilized and added resources for different types of people depending on your circumstance.</h1></div>
