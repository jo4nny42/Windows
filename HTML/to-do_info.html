     <!--Describe techniques used-->
 <div class="techniques"><h1>From a technical perspective the html is simple just divs, buttons and list. On the javascript side this is where I learned new concepts that I would like to learn more about in the future such as span and appendChild concepts i'm not familiar with. This project came from a youtube tutorial but instead of completing a tutorial and adding it to my portfolio I changed it up a little, such as changing the background to resemble a notebook or a piece of paper to tie in the theme of a list. I also used keyframes on the list items where it cycles through colors as the background color.</h1></div>
