        <div><h1 class="decribeText">I created this website in my website development class when I was given the task to make a website on a topic that I am interested in and I chose theater as theater is a big part of my life which I got into in eighth grade and as of July 2024 I have worked in community theater for a couple of months.</h1></div>

    <!--Describe techniques used-->
   <div class="techniques"> <h1>On the surface there is basic HTML with the text images and the singular audio player then I utilized CSS to add some style such as a drop shadow over the text and when you hover over them. The picture change size when you hover and lastly I learned ascroll behavior that I utilize whenever I click to different sections of the page and that is smooth scrolling which can help reduce motion sickness for users that suffer with that.</h1></div>
