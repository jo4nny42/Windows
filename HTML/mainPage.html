                <p class = "mh1">References to mental illness can be found throughout history. The evolution of mental illness, however, has not been linear or progressive but rather cyclical. Whether a behavior is considered normal or abnormal depends on the context surrounding the behavior and thus changes as a function of a particular time and culture. In the past, uncommon behavior or behavior that deviated from the sociocultural norms and expectations of a specific culture and period has been used as a way to silence or control certain individuals or groups. As a result, a less cultural relativist view of abnormal behavior has focused instead on whether behavior poses a threat to oneself or others or causes so much pain and suffering that it interferes with one's work responsibilities or with one's relationships with family and friends.</p>
                
                <p class="mh2">Throughout history there have been three general theories of the etiology of mental illness:
                supernatural, somatogenic, and psychogenic. Supernatural theories attribute mental illness to possession by evil or demonic spirits, displeasure of gods, eclipses, planetary gravitation, curses, and sin. 
                Somatogenic theories identify disturbances in physical functioning resulting from either illness, genetic inheritance, or brain damage or imbalance. Psychogenic theories focus on traumatic or stressful experiences, maladaptive learned associations and cognitions, or distorted perceptions. Etiological theories of mental illness determine the care and treatment mentally ill individuals receive. As we will see below, an individual believed to be possessed by the devil will be viewed and treated differently from an individual believed to be suffering from an excess of yellow bile. Their treatments will also differ, from exorcism to blood-letting. The theories, however, remain the same. They coexist as well as recycle over time.</p>

                <p class="mh3">Trephination is an example of the earliest supernatural explanation for mental illness. Examination of prehistoric skulls and cave art from as early as 6500 BC has identified surgical drilling of holes in skulls to treat head injuries and epilepsy as well as to allow evil spirits trapped within the skull to be released (Restak, 2000). Around 2700 BC, Chinese medicine's concept of complementary positive and negative bodily forces (“yin and yang”) attributed mental (and physical) illness to an imbalance between these forces. As such, a harmonious life that allowed for the proper balance of yin and yang and movement of vital air was essential (Tseng, 1973).</p>

                <p class="mh4">Mesopotamian and Egyptian papyri from 1900 BC describe women suffering from mental illness resulting from a wandering uterus (later named hysteria by the Greeks): The uterus could become dislodged and attached to parts of the body like the liver or chest cavity, preventing their proper functioning or producing varied and sometimes painful symptoms. As a result, the Egyptians, and later the Greeks, also employed a somatogenic treatment of strong smelling substances to guide the uterus back to its proper location (pleasant odors to lure and unpleasant ones to dispel).</p>

                <p class="mh5">Throughout classical antiquity we see a return to supernatural theories of demonic possession or godly displeasure to account for abnormal behavior that was beyond the person's control. Temple attendance with religious healing ceremonies and incantations to the gods were employed to assist in the healing process. Hebrews saw madness as punishment from God, so treatment consisted of confessing sins and repenting. Physicians were also believed to be able to comfort and cure madness, however.</p>

                <p class="mh6">Greek physicians rejected supernatural explanations of mental disorders. It was around 400 BC that Hippocrates (460-370 BC) attempted to separate superstition and religion from medicine by systematizing the belief that a deficiency in or especially an excess of one of the four essential bodily fluids (i.e., humors)—blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm—was responsible for physical and mental illness. For example, someone who was too temperamental suffered from too much blood and thus blood-letting would be the necessary treatment. Hippocrates classified mental illness into one of four categories—epilepsy, mania, melancholia, and brain fever—and like other prominent physicians and philosophers of his time, he did not believe mental illness was shameful or that mentally ill individuals should be held accountable for their behavior. Mentally ill individuals were cared for at home by family members and the state shared no responsibility for their care. Humorism remained a recurrent somatogenic theory up until the 19th century.</p>

                <p class="mh7">While Greek physician Galen (AD 130-201) rejected the notion of a uterus having an animistic soul, he agreed with the notion that an imbalance of the four bodily fluids could cause mental illness. He also opened the door for psychogenic explanations for mental illness, however, by allowing for the experience of psychological stress as a potential cause of abnormality. Galen's psychogenic theories were ignored for centuries, however, as physicians attributed mental illness to physical causes throughout most of the millennium.</p>

                        Many of Hippocrates' medical theories are no longer practiced today. However, he pioneered medicine as an empirical practice and came up with the “Hippocratic oath,” which all doctors must swear to before joining the profession (i.e., the promise to never intentionally harm a patient).

                <p class="mh9">By the late Middle Ages, economic and political turmoil threatened the power of the Roman Catholic church. Between the 11th and 15th centuries, supernatural theories of mental disorders again dominated Europe, fueled by natural disasters like plagues and famines that lay people interpreted as brought about by the devil. Superstition, astrology, and alchemy took hold, and common treatments included prayer rites, relic touching, confessions, and atonement. Beginning in the 13th century the mentally ill, especially women, began to be persecuted as witches who were possessed. At the height of the witch hunts during the 15th through 17th centuries, with the Protestant Reformation having plunged Europe into religious strife, two Dominican monks wrote the Malleus Maleficarum (1486) as the ultimate manual to guide witch hunts. Johann Weyer and Reginald Scot tried to convince people in the mid- to late-16th century that accused witches were actually women with mental illnesses and that mental illness was not due to demonic possession but to faulty metabolism and disease, but the Church’s Inquisition banned both of their writings. Witch-hunting did not decline until the 17th and 18th centuries, after more than 100,000 presumed witches had been burned at the stake (Schoeneman, 1977; Zilboorg & Henry, 1941).</p>

                <p class="mh10">Modern treatments of mental illness are most associated with the establishment of hospitals and asylums beginning in the 16th century. Such institutions’ mission was to house and confine the mentally ill, the poor, the homeless, the unemployed, and the criminal. War and economic depression produced vast numbers of undesirables and these were separated from society and sent to these institutions. Two of the most well-known institutions, St. Mary of Bethlehem in London, known as Bedlam, and the Hôpital Général of Paris—which included La Salpêtrière, La Pitié, and La Bicêtre—began housing mentally ill patients in the mid-16th and 17th centuries. As confinement laws focused on protecting the public from the mentally ill, governments became responsible for housing and feeding undesirables in exchange for their personal liberty. Most inmates were institutionalized against their will, lived in filth and chained to walls, and were commonly exhibited to the public for a fee. Mental illness was nonetheless viewed somatogenically, so treatments were similar to those for physical illnesses: purges, bleedings, and emetics.</p>

                <p class="mh11">While inhumane by today's standards, the view of insanity at the time likened the mentally ill to animals (i.e., animalism) who did not have the capacity to reason, could not control themselves, were capable of violence without provocation, did not have the same physical sensitivity to pain or temperature, and could live in miserable conditions without complaint. As such, instilling fear was believed to be the best way to restore a disordered mind to reason.</p>

                <p class="mh12">By the 18th century, protests rose over the conditions under which the mentally ill lived, and the 18th and 19th centuries saw the growth of a more humanitarian view of mental illness. In 1785 Italian physician Vincenzo Chiarughi (1759-1820) removed the chains of patients at his St. Boniface hospital in Florence, Italy, and encouraged good hygiene and recreational and occupational training. More well known, French physician Philippe Pinel (1745-1826) and former patient Jean-Baptise Pussin created a “traitement moral” at La Bicêtre and the Salpêtrière in 1793 and 1795 that also included unshackling patients, moving them to well-aired, well-lit rooms, and encouraging purposeful activity and freedom to move about the grounds (Micale, 1985).</p>

                <p class="mh13">In England, humanitarian reforms rose from religious concerns. William Tuke (1732-1822) urged the Yorkshire Society of (Quaker) Friends to establish the York Retreat in 1796, where patients were guests, not prisoners, and where the standard of care depended on dignity and courtesy as well as the therapeutic and moral value of physical work (Bell, 1980).</p>

                <p class="mh14">While America had asylums for the mentally ill—such as the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia and the Williamsburg Hospital, established in 1756 and 1773—the somatogenic theory of mental illness of the time—promoted especially by the father of America psychiatry, Benjamin Rush (1745-1813)—had led to treatments such as blood-letting, gyrators, and tranquilizer chairs. When Tuke's York Retreat became the model for half of the new private asylums established in the United States, however, psychogenic treatments such as compassionate care and physical labor became the hallmarks of the new American asylums, such as the Friends Asylum in Frankford, Pennsylvania, and the Bloomingdale Asylum in New York City, established in 1817 and 1821 (Grob, 1994).</p>

                <p class="mh15">Moral treatment had to be abandoned in America in the second half of the 19th century, however, when these asylums became overcrowded and custodial in nature and could no longer provide the space nor attention necessary. When retired school teacher Dorothea Dix discovered the negligence that resulted from such conditions, she advocated for the establishment of state hospitals. Between 1840 and1880, she helped establish over 30 mental institutions in the United States and Canada (Viney & Zorich, 1982). By the late 19th century, moral treatment had given way to the mental hygiene movement, founded by former patient Clifford Beers with the publication of his 1908 memoir A Mind That Found Itself. Riding on Pasteur's breakthrough germ theory of the 1860s and 1870s and especially on the early 20th century discoveries of vaccines for cholera, syphilis, and typhus, the mental hygiene movement reverted to a somatogenic theory of mental illness.</p>

                <p class="mh16">European psychiatry in the late 18th century and throughout the 19th century, however, struggled between somatogenic and psychogenic explanations of mental illness, particularly hysteria, which caused physical symptoms such as blindness or paralysis with no apparent physiological explanation. Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815), influenced by contemporary discoveries in electricity, attributed hysterical symptoms to imbalances in a universal magnetic fluid found in individuals, rather than to a wandering uterus (Forrest, 1999). James Braid (1795-1860) shifted this belief in mesmerism to one in hypnosis, thereby proposing a psychogenic treatment for the removal of symptoms. At the time, famed Salpetriere Hospital neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893), and Ambroise Auguste Liébault (1823-1904) and Hyppolyte Bernheim (1840-1919) of the Nancy School in France, were engaged in a bitter etiological battle over hysteria, with Charcot maintaining that the hypnotic suggestibility underlying hysteria was a neurological condition while Liébault and Bernheim believed it to be a general trait that varied in the population. Josef Breuer (1842-1925) and Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) would resolve this dispute in favor of a psychogenic explanation for mental illness by treating hysteria through hypnosis, which eventually led to the cathartic method that became the precursor for psychoanalysis during the first half of the 20th century.</p>

                <p class="mh17">Psychoanalysis was the dominant psychogenic treatment for mental illness during the first half of the 20th century, providing the launching pad for the more than 400 different schools of psychotherapy found today (Magnavita, 2006). Most of these schools cluster around broader behavioral, cognitive, cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and client-centered approaches to psychotherapy applied in individual, marital, family, or group formats. Negligible differences have been found among all these approaches, however; their efficacy in treating mental illness is due to factors shared among all of the approaches (not particular elements specific to each approach): the therapist-patient alliance, the therapist's allegiance to the therapy, therapist competence, and placebo effects (Luborsky et al., 2002; Messer & Wampold, 2002).</p>

                <p class="mh18">In contrast, the leading somatogenic treatment for mental illness can be found in the establishment of the first psychotropic medications in the mid-20th century. Restraints, electro-convulsive shock therapy, and lobotomies continued to be employed in American state institutions until the 1970s, but they quickly made way for a burgeoning pharmaceutical industry that has viewed and treated mental illness as a chemical imbalance in the brain.</p>

                <p class="mh19">Both etiological theories coexist today in what the psychological discipline holds as the biopsychosocial model of explaining human behavior. While individuals may be born with a genetic predisposition for a certain psychological disorder, certain psychological stressors need to be present for them to develop the disorder. Sociocultural factors such as sociopolitical or economic unrest, poor living conditions, or problematic interpersonal relationships are also viewed as contributing factors. However much we want to believe that we are above the treatments described above, or that the present is always the most enlightened time, let us not forget that our thinking today continues to reflect the same underlying somatogenic and psychogenic theories of mental illness discussed throughout this cursory 9,000-year history.</p>

        <div class = "stats">
            <p>Such nuanced descriptions for depression and other mental illnesses—adopted by the Black community and passed on from generation to generation—led to underestimating the effects and impact of mental health conditions. Also, it strengthened beliefs that a psychiatric disorder is a personal weakness.</p>

            <p>Black Americans develop mental health conditions at a rate equal to anyone else. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has declared racism a serious threat to public health that has placed communities of color at greater risk for poor health outcomes.</p>

            <p>Researchers believe that racial trauma is one of the reasons Black people in some communities have higher rates of PTSD (8.7%) compared to white people (7.4%).</p>

            <p>Studies also show that African American youth are at risk of developing PTSD: Nearly 65% of African American youth report traumatic experiences, compared to 30% of their peers from other ethnic groups.</p>

            <p>Black people are far less likely to seek care. Statistics tell us that about 25% of African Americans seek mental health treatment, compared to 40% of white Americans.</p>

            <p>In one study, physicians working with Black patients were 33% less likely to engage in patient-centered communications than they were with white patients. Such discriminatory practices have been connected to patients' increased psychological distress.</p>

            <p>According to the work of psychologist Nancy Boyd-Franklin, early models of mental health care and family therapy were established to treat white middle-class families. These forms of therapy pathologized Black families that were structured differently from white families in any way.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, only 2% of U.S. psychologists are Black.</p>

            <p>Black men, especially, receive the message to be strong and to deal with problems on their own. This masking of issues can lead to greater symptoms of anxiety and depression and to self-medicating through substances, such as drugs or alcohol.</p>

            <p>Disparities in health care can prevent people from the African American community from receiving care. Approximately 30% of Black adults receive treatment each year compared to 43% of white adults.</p>

            <p>Among AAPI folks, mental illness can be seen as a source of shame. Using mental health services may be seen as an admission that something is wrong not just with an individual, but the whole family</p>

            <p>However, the stigma around seeking help appears to be shifting between generations. Research shows that a person's comfort level with U.S. mental health treatment can vary by generation. U.S.-born, third-generation AAPIs access more health care than first- or second-generation family members.</p>

            <p>People who have experienced multiple traumas throughout their lives are at greater risk for experiencing another trauma. They also experience more severe symptoms and longer lasting effects.</p>

            <p>Stigma, as it relates to mental health, is when people who experience mental illness are viewed or view themselves in a negative light.</p>

            <p>Stereotypes include beliefs that people are responsible for their mental health issues or that those with mental illness are more likely to be dangerous.</p>

            <p>Self-stigma happens when someone with mental illness applies negative public views to themselves. They observe others' negative attitudes. Often, they believe they are unworthy or should be able to control their symptoms through willpower.</p>

            <p>Many societies expect men to be tough and to hide their emotions. This expectation means men are far less likely to seek help than women, but also have increased rates of depression and suicide.</p>

            <p>Women are often expected to show traditional feminine traits, such as gentleness and emotionality. They are criticized for being “hysterical,” but also for displaying traditional masculine traits, such as competitiveness or aggression.</p>

            <p>Women with children can fear being labeled unfit mothers if they are experiencing depression or anxiety.</p>

            <p>A recent study found that one in three LGBTQ+ adults experienced mental illness as compared to one in five heterosexual adults.</p>

            <p>There is a 40% lifetime suicide attempt prevalence among transgender people. For comparison, the U.S. population's lifetime suicide attempt rate is 4.6%. This rate drops dramatically when transgender people can access gender-affirming medical care.</p>

            <p>A 2018 SAMHSA report revealed that 8.6 million Hispanic adults in the U.S. had either a mental health disorder, including substance use disorders, with 1.5 million of these adults having a serious mental illness. Of adults with serious mental illness, 57% of those under the age of 25 did not get any treatment (approximately 276,000). Of those ages 26-49, 40% had no treatment (approximately 308,000).</p>

            <p>Some Latinx people have lived in the U.S. for many generations, while others are recent immigrants. First- and second-generation immigrants often experience challenges with combining their former and new cultures they've lived in. The difficulties of blending cultures can pose unique mental health challenges for Latinx folks.</p>
