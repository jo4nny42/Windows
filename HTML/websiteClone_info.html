         <!--Describe techniques used-->
     <div class="techniques"><h1>One of the biggest skills I utilized on this page was practicing using flexbox and grid, the more I used these techniques the better organizing as I used to use position primarily as as a way of placing items but as I worked on being a better developer I changed my methods. I tried my best to do a 1 to 1 replication of the website despite the pictures and this was a fun project but to do with a few breaks along the way but with eveything said and done I am proud of the work i've done.</h1></div>
