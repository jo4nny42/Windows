                        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                        <li>4 teaspoons dried parsley</li>

                        <li>2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>

                        <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce or a pinch of cayenne</li>
                        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                        <li>One 10 to 12-pound turkey</li>
                        <li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
                        <li>1 head garlic, halved across the garlic cloves</li>
                        <li>Several sprigs fresh herbs, such as thyme, parsley, rosemary and sage</li>
                        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Adjust a rack in the lowest position and preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Set a roasting rack in a large roasting pan.</li>
                        <li>Stir together the mayonnaise, paprika, dried parsley, garlic powder, dried thyme, ground sage, hot sauce, 2 tablespoons salt and 2 teaspoons black pepper in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Remove any turkey parts from the neck and breast cavities and reserve for other uses if desired. Dry the bird well with paper towels, inside and out. Rub the mayonnaise mixture all over the turkey, including the cavity, trying to make it as smooth as possible, especially on the breast so it browns evenly. Stuff the cavity with the onion, garlic, herb sprigs and bay leaves.</li>
                        <li>Set the bird breast-side up on the prepared roasting rack. Tent the bird with foil.</li>
                        <li>Roast the turkey for 2 hours. Remove the foil and increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F. Add a cup of water to the bottom of the pan so that the drippings don't burn and continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees F in the thigh, 30 to 45 minutes. Let the turkey rest about 20 minutes before carving. You can strain the pan drippings and serve them on the side or reserve and blend them into your gravy for extra flavor.</li>

A slather of mayonnaise on your turkey pulls double duty by standing in as a flavorful rub as well as adding moisture and fat to often dry meat.

                            <li>1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted, plus more for buttering the baking dish</li>
                            <li>3 to 4 large sweet potatoes (about 1 3/4 pounds), peeled and cubed </li>

                        <h2>Topping:</h2>
                        <ul>

                        <ol>
                            <li>For the sweet potatoes: Add 1 3/4 pounds peeled and cubed sweet potatoes to a large pot of salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and cool. Mash the sweet potatoes.</li>
                            <li>For the filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 2-quart baking dish.</li>
                            <li>Whisk together the butter, mashed sweet potatoes, milk, brown sugar, vanilla, salt and eggs in a large bowl. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
                            <li>For the topping: Combine the flour, brown sugar, butter and salt in a medium bowl until moist and the mixture clumps together. Stir in the pecans. Sprinkle the mixture over the top of the sweet potatoes in an even layer. Bake until mostly set in the center and golden on top, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve hot.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>For the cheese: Spread some flour for dredging in a shallow bowl. Beat the egg in a second shallow bowl with a splash of water and a pinch of salt. Put the panko in a third shallow bowl, drizzle with the butter and toss well to coat. Add the parsley, chives, thyme and lemon zest and toss with the breadcrumbs. Line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
                        <li>Dredge the cheese round well in the flour. Coat in the egg, letting the excess drip back into the bowl. Dredge well in the breadcrumb mixture. Coat once more in the egg, then the breadcrumbs, making sure the cheese is well coated. Place on the baking sheet and freeze until solid, at least 2 hours. (It can also be made and frozen a day or two ahead.)</li>
                        <li>For the cranberry sauce: Meanwhile, combine the cranberry sauce, vinegar, coriander, thyme, salt and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer and whisk to combine. Simmer over medium until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Let cool and transfer to a serving bowl. (The sauce can be made a day or two ahead as well; keep refrigerated until ready to serve.)</li>
                        <li>When ready to serve, position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F.</li>
                        <li>Transfer the baking sheet with the cheese to the middle rack and bake until the crumbs are crisp and golden all over, 25 to 30 minutes. Use a wide spatula to transfer to a serving platter. Serve with crackers or crudité and the tangy cranberry sauce on the side.</li>

                            <li>5 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and chopped into large chunks</li>
                            <li>12 ounces pancetta, finely chopped</li>

                            <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with water by at least 1 inch. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then adjust the heat and continue to boil until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the potatoes and let them sit in the colander to dry out a little, about 10 minutes. Place back into the pot.</li>
                            <li>Meanwhile, cook the pancetta in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, 7 to 9 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a bowl lined with a paper towel to drain.</li>
                            <li>Add the Parmesan, cream, nutmeg, 14 tablespoons of the butter, 1 tablespoon salt and a generous amount of black pepper to the pot with the potatoes. Mash with a potato masher until well combined and the potatoes are silky smooth. Whisk the eggs and yolks together in a medium bowl then pour into the potatoes and stir until well combined. Fold in all but 1 tablespoon of the pancetta.</li>
                            <li>Spoon 2 cups of the mashed potatoes into the bottom of a 3-quart oval baking dish. Place the remaining potatoes in a large piping bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe 2-inch-wide dollops on top of the potatoes in the casserole, piping until they are completely covered. Refill the piping bag with any remaining potatoes left in the pot and pipe into the dish. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon pancetta.</li>
                            <li>Bake until the potatoes are golden brown on top and around the edges, about 30 minutes. Dice the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into small pieces and scatter over the top of the potatoes. Let the butter melt while the potatoes cool, about 15 minutes.</li>
